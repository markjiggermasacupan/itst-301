            I am Masacupan, Mark Jigger V. (born April 20, 2000 at Siniloa, Laguna), growing up in the
            the Municipality of Pangil, Laguna. He was family-oriented, friendly, and energetic.<br><br>
            He doesn't like user-friendly who takes advantage of kindness personality, and tends to reconciliates
            with socialization because of being ambivert and being quiet, he don't normally socialize quickly by just analyzing first the behaviour of person before he talks himself. He is loving-respect and truly cares for
            people who arounds him and what he is doing right is now is hardworking to be an student, chase dreams, and
            be an Professional IT someday.
